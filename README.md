pygment-flask
=============

A basic RESTFul Flask wrapper for Pygments, currently only exposes 2 methods:  

pygment_code: determines which lexer to use, and the pygments / highlights the code using the HtmlFormatter  
guess_code: uses the guess_lexer method to try aid in determining which lexer to use.
